Face Recognition Attendance System
A robust, multi-user face recognition attendance system built with Streamlit, OpenCV, DeepFace, and Excel for easy management and reporting.
Features
Multi-frame registration: Users register with multiple face images for higher accuracy.
Flexible anti-spoofing: System can be strict (live faces only) or flexible (accepts images).
Attendance marking: Users mark attendance by face verification.
Admin portal: Manage lecturers, course reps, students, and regenerate all embeddings.
Excel logs: Attendance and confirmation logs are saved in Excel files.
Email notifications: Sends attendance confirmation emails to students.
Daily summary: View daily attendance and absences by course.
User-friendly UI: Built with Streamlit for easy use.

Tips
For best accuracy, register with clear, well-lit images from multiple angles.
If using images (not live faces), set anti_spoofing=False in DeepFace calls.
For production, set anti_spoofing=True for maximum security.
Admin password is set in the script (ADMIN_PASSWORD). Change it for security.
